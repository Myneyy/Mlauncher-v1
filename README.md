## About
MLauncher is a personal launcher I created to showcase my projects in a creative and organized way. This first version is more of a sneak peek of what's coming.

The goal of MLauncher is to allow everyone to create their own custom launcher, upload their projects, and manage them in one place. It’s designed to be a platform where users can personalize their launcher and share their work with others.

## Features
- Showcase and run my personal projects
- Easy login and registration using HWID
- Simple and intuitive interface for managing multiple projects
- Fully customizable interface

---

## Future Plans
- Work in progress: soon anyone will be able to upload their own projects
- Enhanced customization options for each launcher
- Integration with more project types (games, apps, tools, etc.)
